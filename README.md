# letmelog.in

A useful way to break out of [Captive
Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal) issues.

[letmelog.in](http://letmelog.in) is only accessible over HTTP, so your router
can intercept it as they see fit.

Similar to many other solutions, but with:

- A nice, easy-to-remember domain name
- A success page that's nice to look at
- A domain name that I plan to pay for indefinitely
